# Cursor Shared Skills Repo

This repository contains **shared Cursor Agent Skills** for Smeetz. It is not a product codebase.

- **Skills** live in `skills/<skill-name>/`. Each skill has a required `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter `name`, `description` + body) and optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`.
- **Only non–project-specific** skills belong here. Project-specific skills stay in each project’s `.cursor/skills/`.
- **Adding a skill:** Copy `skills/_template/` to `skills/<skill-name>/`, edit `SKILL.md`, update the README skills table. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Content language:** English only for all skill content and repo docs.
